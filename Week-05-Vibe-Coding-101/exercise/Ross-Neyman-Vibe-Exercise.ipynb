    "# Vibe Coding: Real-World Data Cleaning Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a Data Analyst at **TechSalary Insights**. Your manager needs answers to critical business questions, but the data is messy. Your job is to clean it and provide accurate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The catch:** You must figure out how to clean the data yourself. No step by step hints just you, your AI assistant, and real world messy data.\n",

    "## The Dataset: Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "**Location:** `../Week-02-Pandas-Part-2-and-DS-Overview/data/Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021 (Responses) - Form Responses 1.tsv`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **real survey data** from Ask A Manager's 2021 salary survey with over 28,000 responses from working professionals. The data comes from this survey: https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset is perfect for vibe coding:**\n",
    "- Real human responses (inconsistent formatting)\n",
    "- Multiple currencies and formats  \n",
    "- Messy job titles and location data\n",
    "- Missing and invalid entries\n",
    "- Requires business judgment calls\n",

    "\n",
    "## Your Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer these **exact questions** with clean data. There's only one correct answer for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Questions (Required):\n",
    "1. **What is the median salary for Software Engineers in the United States?** \n",
    "2. **Which US state has the highest average salary for tech workers?**\n",
    "3. **How much does salary increase on average for each year of experience in tech?**\n",
    "4. **Which industry (besides tech) has the highest median salary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Questions (If time permits):\n",
    "5. **What's the salary gap between men and women in tech roles?**\n",
    "6. **Do people with Master's degrees earn significantly more than those with Bachelor's degrees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:** Your final answers will be compared against the \"official\" results. Data cleaning approaches can vary, but final numbers should be within 5% of expected values.\n"

    "\n",
    "## My Data Cleaning Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Initial Data Loading & Exploration\n",
    "- [ ] Load the TSV file with proper separator\n",
    "- [ ] Check the shape of the dataset (rows, columns)\n",
    "- [ ] Examine column names and data types\n",
    "- [ ] Look at first/last few rows to understand structure\n",
    "- [ ] Check for missing values across all columns\n",
    "- [ ] Get summary statistics for numeric columns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Column Standardization & Cleanup\n",
    "- [ ] Rename columns to shorter, code-friendly names (e.g., 'What industry do you work in?' → 'industry')\n",
    "- [ ] Identify which columns are needed for analysis:\n",
    "  - Timestamp (for date filtering)\n",
    "  - Age\n",
    "  - Industry\n",
    "  - Job title\n",
    "  - Salary\n",
    "  - Currency\n",

    "- [ ] Drop unnecessary columns (additional context fields, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Critical Data Cleaning - Currency & Salary\n",
    "- [ ] **CURRENCY STANDARDIZATION:**\n",
    "  - Filter to USD only (since questions focus on US data)\n",
    "  - Or implement currency conversion if needed for non-tech industries\n",
    "- [ ] **SALARY CLEANING:**\n",
    "  - Convert salary column to numeric (handle text, commas, etc.)\n",
    "  - Remove obviously invalid salaries (0, negative, unrealistic values like >$1M or <$10k)\n",
    "  - Handle missing salary values (drop rows)\n",
    "  - Check for outliers and decide on reasonable bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4: Geographic Data Cleaning\n",
    "- [ ] **COUNTRY STANDARDIZATION:**\n",
    "  - Standardize US variations: 'US', 'USA', 'United States', 'usa', 'U.S.', etc. → 'US'\n",
    "  - Keep track of other countries for industry comparison\n",
    "- [ ] **STATE CLEANING (US only):**\n",
    "  - Check for state name variations and inconsistencies\n",

    "  - Create flexible matching (case-insensitive, contains 'software' and 'engineer')\n",
    "  - Consider related titles: 'Developer', 'SWE', 'Software Dev', etc.\n",
    "- [ ] **DATA QUALITY - SUSPICIOUS ENTRIES:**\n",
    "  - Identify suspicious job title + salary combinations\n",
    "  - Flag or remove obvious joke/fake entries like:\n",
    "    - Job titles: \"bum\", \"unemployed\", \"student\", \"none\", etc.\n",
    "    - Job titles with profanity or gibberish\n",
    "  - Consider reasonable salary ranges by job category (optional, but helpful)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 6: Experience & Education Cleaning\n",
    "- [ ] **YEARS OF EXPERIENCE:**\n",
    "  - Convert text ranges to numeric values ('5-7 years' → 6, '8-10 years' → 9)\n",
    "  - Handle '1 year or less' → 0.5 or 1\n",
    "  - Handle '21-30 years' or '31+ years'\n",
    "  - Create numeric field_experience column\n",
    "- [ ] **EDUCATION:**\n",

    "  - Create Bachelor's vs Master's groups for comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 7: Gender Data Cleaning (for bonus question)\n",
    "- [ ] Standardize gender values\n",
    "- [ ] Handle variations: 'Man', 'Woman', etc.\n",
    "- [ ] Decide how to handle non-binary/other for gap analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 8: Date Filtering\n",
    "- [ ] Convert timestamp to datetime\n",
    "- [ ] Verify all data is from 2021 (survey year)\n",
    "- [ ] Filter if needed for specific time ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 9: Answer Business Questions\n",
    "- [ ] **Q1: Median salary for Software Engineers in US**\n",
    "  - Filter: country='US', job_title contains 'software engineer', currency='USD'\n",
    "  - Calculate median\n",
    "- [ ] **Q2: Highest paying US state for tech workers**\n",
    "  - Filter: country='US', industry='Computing or Tech', currency='USD'\n",

    "  - Filter: education level, tech or all industries\n",
    "  - Compare median salaries\n",
    "  - Statistical significance test if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 10: Validation & Quality Checks\n",
    "- [ ] Verify sample sizes for each analysis (ensure sufficient data)\n",
    "- [ ] Check for and document any assumptions made\n",
    "- [ ] Sanity check all final numbers (do they make sense?)\n",
    "- [ ] Document edge cases and how they were handled\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 11: Documentation\n",

    "**Summarize your findings here:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Median salary for Software Engineers in US:** \n",
    "2. **Highest paying US state for tech:** California, Oregon\n",
    "3. **Salary increase per year of experience:** $2,995.19\n",
    "4. **Remote vs office percentage:** This data doesn't exist\n",
    "5. **Highest paying non-tech industry:** Corporate Training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "- Specify where you want the code to be written, sometimes Claude decided I needed to do 2 tasks in one cell and another task across 3\n",
    "- At least have an idea on how the work should be done, I had to remind Claude to use regex instead of making a list of every possible way to describe \"US\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges faced:**\n",
    "- The data didn't exist within the survey responses about remote vs in-person work. I argued with Claude until I checked the dataset myself and realized this question was supposed to trip me up\n",
    "- For the answers to the questions, Claude made the code incredibly bloated. Almost as if we didn't just spend 45 minutes of my time together making the dataset easier to work with. I solved this by instructing the agent to not make things overly complicated and just answer the question with some basic context\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you learned about vibe coding:**\n",
    "- You will get very bored waiting for responses sometimes\n",
    "- I don't think my job is too much at risk anymore\n",
    "- Don't do it after already trying to watch a toddler at home, you will end up with a broken keyboard\n"
