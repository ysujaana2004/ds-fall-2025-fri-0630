    "## The Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a Data Analyst at **TechSalary Insights**. Your manager needs answers to critical business questions, but the data is messy. Your job is to clean it and provide accurate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The catch:** You must figure out how to clean the data yourself. No step by step hints just you, your AI assistant, and real world messy data.\n",

    "## The Dataset: Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "**Location:** `../Week-02-Pandas-Part-2-and-DS-Overview/data/Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021 (Responses) - Form Responses 1.tsv`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **real survey data** from Ask A Manager's 2021 salary survey with over 28,000 responses from working professionals. The data comes from this survey: https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset is perfect for vibe coding:**\n",
    "- Real human responses (inconsistent formatting)\n",
    "- Multiple currencies and formats  \n",
    "- Messy job titles and location data\n",
    "- Missing and invalid entries\n",
    "- Requires business judgment calls\n",

    "## Your Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer these **exact questions** with clean data. There's only one correct answer for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Questions (Required):\n",
    "1. **What is the median salary for Software Engineers in the United States?** \n",
    "2. **Which US state has the highest average salary for tech workers?**\n",
    "3. **How much does salary increase on average for each year of experience in tech?**\n",
    "4. **Which industry (besides tech) has the highest median salary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Questions (If time permits):\n",
    "5. **What's the salary gap between men and women in tech roles?**\n",
    "6. **Do people with Master's degrees earn significantly more than those with Bachelor's degrees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:** Your final answers will be compared against the \"official\" results. Data cleaning approaches can vary, but final numbers should be within 5% of expected values.\n"

    "## Final Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Questions - Final Answers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Median salary for Software Engineers in the US:** Calculated from the cleaned dataset.  \n",
    "2. **Highest paying US state for tech workers:** Determined from state-level salary analysis.  \n",
    "3. **Average salary increase per year of experience in tech:** Estimated using linear regression on experience vs. mean salary.  \n",
    "4. **Highest paying non-tech industry:** Identified after filtering out tech-related industries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus Question - Final Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Gender salary gap in tech:** Calculated by comparing median salaries of men and women in tech roles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Processed over 28,000 survey responses, focusing on US-based respondents with USD salaries.  \n",
    "- Identified tech roles using keyword-based matching on job titles.  \n",
    "- Removed unrealistic salary outliers, keeping the $10,000–$500,000 range for reliable analysis.  \n",
    "- Converted experience ranges to midpoint numeric values to enable regression analysis.  \n",
    "- Applied minimum sample size thresholds for states and industries to ensure statistical validity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Cleaning Challenges & Solutions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Challenge:** Salary data in multiple formats and currencies.  \n",
    "   **Solution:** Applied a regex-based cleaning function, filtered for USD, and removed outliers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Challenge:** Inconsistent job title formatting.  \n",
    "   **Solution:** Used keyword-based logic to classify tech roles and software engineers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Challenge:** Experience data provided as ranges rather than exact years.  \n",
    "   **Solution:** Mapped ranges to midpoint values for quantitative analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Challenge:** Industries and states with very few respondents.  \n",
    "   **Solution:** Applied minimum sample size filters to ensure reliable statistics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Challenge:** Missing or inconsistent location data.  \n",
    "   **Solution:** Retained only records with valid US state information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices Learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Begin with exploratory data analysis to understand structure and anomalies.  \n",
    "- Use reasonable assumptions for missing or ambiguous data.  \n",
    "- Validate each cleaning step with summary statistics.  \n",
    "- Ensure statistical rigor by filtering out outliers and small sample groups.  \n",
    "- Iteratively refine data cleaning and analysis to maintain high-quality results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools and Techniques Used:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and cleaning.  \n",
    "- **Regex:** Standardizing and extracting numeric salary values.  \n",
    "- **Scipy:** Linear regression to estimate salary growth with experience.  \n",
    "- **Groupby & Aggregation:** Computing summary statistics for states, industries, and demographics.\n"
